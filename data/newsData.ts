      <p>In a strategic move to enhance local coordination and engagement for the upcoming FOLICEA Summit 2025, the Federation of Liberian Christian Ex-pats in Africa (FOLICEA) has officially established a National Liaison Committee (NLC) in Liberia.</p>
      <p>The committee will be chaired by the distinguished Al-Ro T. Nelson, a prominent figure known for his dedication to community service and organizational leadership. The NLC will serve as the primary point of contact in Liberia, facilitating communication and logistics for delegates planning to attend the summit in Kampala, Uganda.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Strengthening the Home Front</h3>
      <p>The establishment of the NLC is a testament to FOLICEA's commitment to ensuring broad participation and seamless coordination. Chairman Al-Ro T. Nelson will lead the committee in its efforts to disseminate information, assist with registration, and address inquiries from prospective attendees within Liberia.</p>
      <p>"I am deeply honored to accept this responsibility," said Mr. Nelson. "The FOLICEA Summit is a vital platform for our diaspora, and the NLC will work diligently to ensure that the Liberian delegation is well-prepared and well-represented. We are here to support our brothers and sisters every step of the way."</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">A Bridge to the Summit</h3>
      <p>The NLC will play a crucial role in bridging the gap between the Central Summit Committee and the community in Liberia. Its responsibilities will include organizing pre-summit briefings, managing group travel arrangements, and fostering a sense of unity among the delegates.</p>
      <p>This initiative is expected to significantly boost participation from Liberia, making the 2025 summit one of the most inclusive and representative gatherings in FOLICEA's history.</p>
